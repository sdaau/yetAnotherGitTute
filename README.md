# Yet another Git tutorial

This is a brief tutorial on the SCM ([Source Control or Source Code Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management)) - aka VCS (Version Control System) - software [`git`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). It will focus on an offline (local) demonstration of basic operations, as well as conflicts and resolving them.

Crudely speaking, SCM/VCS allows one to track history of changes of files in a directory - the user creates, modifies or deletes files inside this directory; and the user can choose, at any time, to record the current state of the files in history by _committing_ them, the recorded state being known as a _commit_.

As more commits are added to the history, an SCM/VCS allows that the exact state of a previous commit can be restored in the working directory - which is particularly useful in software coding; say, in cases when a bug has been introduced by a more recent change (which should otherwise introduce a new feature). Such a directory, with contents with tracked history, is typically referred to as a _project_ or a _repository_ (that is, "repo").

Before we get going, note that:

* Git/`git` is the name of the SCM/VCS system and software, with a homepage at https://git-scm.com/
* GitHub is the name of a company, which offers hosting services and tools for `git` projects, with a homepage at https://github.com/ (one among many others, such as SourceForge https://sourceforge.net/ GitLab https://gitlab.com/ Bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/ etc).

This tutorial has been tested on git version 1.9.1 on Ubuntu 14.04, a GNU/Linux operating system (OS). As such, it should be easy to follow on similar OS, that follow the [Unix filesystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem) convention, provided that `git` is installed:

* On Linux systems, use your package manager to install; say, on Ubuntu, you can just type `git` in a terminal, and it will remind you to `sudo apt-get install git` if not already installed
* MacOS/OSX systems also follow the Unix filesystem convention, and similarly, you can open [Terminal.app](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac-software/how-use-terminal-on-mac-3608274/) and just type `git`, and you will be prompted to install [Command Line Developer Tools](https://www.macissues.com/2014/05/26/what-are-the-command-line-developer-tools-in-os-x/) that also contain `git`
    * Note that both MacOS/OSX and Ubuntu, provide a command line intepreter (a.k.a. _shell_) called [`bash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
* For Windows, you can install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which will install a "Git Bash" program, which will then also provide the same `bash` shell (and an emulation of an Unix filesystem) with a `git` command, as under GNU/Linux or MacOS/OSX

This tutorial will operate in the temporary `/tmp` directory of the filesystem; and will be illustrated by screenshots, taken on Ubuntu 14.04 (see the [pyvirtdisp-starter.py](pyvirtdisp-starter.py) in this repo) - where each related `git` directory will have its own terminal (here, `gnome-terminal`), own file manager (here, `pcmanfm`), and own Git GUI client (here, `giggle`; for more, see [Git - GUI Clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis)).

The tutorial will start with creating a "main" `git` project directory, which will simulate online repositories, such as those found on GitHub or other services. Then, it will illustrate how two users, [Alice and Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob), work in their respective copies of the "main" repositories, and update (or synchronize) the "main" repository with their own changes.
